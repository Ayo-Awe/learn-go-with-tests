## Learn Go With Tests: My TDD Solutions

This repository holds my solutions to the test-driven development (TDD) exercises from [Learn Go With Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/).

### What is Learn Go With Tests?

[Learn Go With Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) is a hands-on guide that helps you master Go through the practice of Test Driven Development (TDD). By writing tests first, you'll solidify your understanding of Go concepts and craft cleaner, more reliable code.

### Dive into the Exercises

This repository showcases my solutions to the TDD exercises presented in the resource. Each module from the resource has its own dedicated folder:

- **Folder Name:** Represents the specific module.
- **xxx.go:** Contains the implementation code for the exercise.
- **xxx_test.go:** Holds the corresponding unit tests.

### Run the Tests

To execute all tests, navigate to the repository directory and run the following command:

```bash
go run -v ./...
```

**Note**: This requires Go version 1.22 (or later).
